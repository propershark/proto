# Proper Shark Protocol

This repository acts as the reference for the interface that the Proper Shark ecosystem exposes and utilizes.

# Making Changes

Changes should be proposed via GitHub Issues. Families of interfaces may be grouped into a single issue, but prefer creating individual issues whenever possible.

The issue will be used to discuss whether or not the change should be accepted and to determine general semantics regarding the change.

Once a change has been accepted, create a Pull Request containing the appropriate changes to the reference materials. For new interfaces, this will generally mean adding a new entry to the `data` directory. For modifications to existing interfaces, this will generally mean updating the files for the respective interfaces.

The PR will be accepted and merged once the changes have been approved and agreed upon.
